## Day 1

1.Problem :Query the total population of all cities in CITY where District is California.
My solution :
select sum(population) from city where district = 'California';
## sum() to get aggregation of a column or total value of a field, can also be combined with WHERE condition .

2.problem :Query the average population of all cities in CITY where District is California
My solution:
select avg(population) from city where district = 'California';
## function avg() is used to find average of a column.

3.Problem:Query the average population for all cities in CITY, rounded down to the nearest i
My solution:
select floor(avg(population)) from city; 
## floor () is used to round to nearest integer 
syntax : floor(avg(col_name))

4:Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
my sol
select city from station where city like 'a%'
or city like 'e%'
or city like 'i%'
or city like 'o%'
or city like 'u%';
## like keyword is used to get a pattern from a field , here OR is used and AND is not used because , AND will select only when a country name starts with all vowels .


5.Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
my sol:
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE
  (city LIKE 'a%' OR city LIKE 'e%' OR city LIKE 'i%' OR city LIKE 'o%' OR city LIKE 'u%')
  AND
  (city LIKE '%a' OR city LIKE '%e' OR city LIKE '%i' OR city LIKE '%o' OR city LIKE '%u');
## when to satisfy both conditions we use "AND".

6.Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels.
my sol:
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE city NOT REGEXP '[aeiou]$';

## learnt new keyword or function instead of "like" ,"REGEXP"
syntax : 
col_name REGEXP '^[pattern]' ; ##  ^ for starting character 
col_name REGEXP '[pattern]$' ; ##  $ for ending character 

7.Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
my sol:

SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE city NOT REGEXP '^[aeiou]'OR
city not REGEXP '[aeiou]$';
